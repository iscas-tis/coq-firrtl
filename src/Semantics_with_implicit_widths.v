(* This file shows a possible development of the semantics.
   It should be organized in Sections as follows.

   0. Outside the sections mentioned below, some preliminary definitions
      are given, e.g. a ftype_mux function that is compatible with the
      width and reset inference.
      In a final version these might be moved to a separate file.

   1. Section Kinds_and_Types finds the original types and kinds of all
      components in the modules of the circuit.
      Its result is circuit_tmap_uninferred.
      If the result is <> None, that means that all types are almost
      compatible (the widths may be different, but the types are equal),
      except that abstract Reset signals may be connected to UInt and
      to AsyncReset.

   2. Section InferWidths_and_InferReset infers the widths and the Reset
      type of all components in the modules of the circuit.
      (This is done through calculating a fixed point, in fact the
      smallest fixed point of a monotonous operator.)

      It assumes that circuit_tmap_uninferred <> None.

      Its result is the adapted type-and-kind map circuit_tmap, which
      contains no more unspecified widths or abstract Reset signals.
      If the result is a true fixed point, that means that all types
      are fully compatible.

      The fixed point may take many iterations to compute.  One example
      of a hard circuit is this:

      circuit Top :
          module Top :
              input limit : UInt<128>
              output counter : UInt

              register intern : UInt
              intern <= counter
              counter <= rem(add(intern, UInt(1)), limit)

      Although this circuit has only two connect statements, it takes
      128 iterations to reach the fixed point.  The count-to-infinity
      situation for the register and the counter is broken off by the
      limit.  However, I find it difficult to find a general rule for
      an a-priori maximum number of iterations, or for an acceleration
      of iteration (basically, the acceleration should find that the
      minimum width of the rem() operator should come from limit, not
      from the add() argument).

   3. Section Instances creates a map that defines all instances in
      the circuit.

      It assumes that the top module is present in the circuit, that
      all instance statements refer to existing modules (this would
      also be a consequence ot circuit_tmap_uninferred <> None), and
      that there are no cycles in instance statements.

   4. Section Values defines values and calculates a value for every
      expression, given values for the references.

      There are a number of special values to accommodate for undefined
      expressions: uninitialized registers, not yet determined, or
      left undefined on purpose.

      It works with explicit-width, concrete types only; so it assumes
      that all references and expressions have explicit widths and no
      abstract resets.

   5. Section Single_Cycle_Dynamics creates a function that maps
      (old) register values and external inputs to a value map of all
      components in the instances of the circuit after stabilization.
      (This is again done through calculating a fixed point; however,
      this fixed point is defined because there should be no cyclic
      computations.)

      It assumes that there exists a number iter_count such that after
      iter_count iterations in the previous section, circuit_tmap has
      been calculated properly.

      It also assumes that the top module is present.

   Result: the smallest ground type that can encompass both x and y without data loss

   The result also takes into account that abstract reset types might be concretized;
   therefore, an abstract reset type should unify with both synchronous and asynchronous
   resets.  This also has implications for a few other cases; overall, the choices
   below ensure that fgtyp_mux is associative and monotonous. *)

Section Single_Cycle_Dynamics.

(* We first need a function to replace a part of a reference with a new value,
   to execute a connect statement.

   However, the recursion of references href and the recursion of storage
   in array_value/bundle_value works the other way round, so it is difficult
   to just create a recursive function that accesses it.

   For example, if r has type "Atyp (Btyp (Fflips fld Nflip (Fuint 2) Fnil)) 3" and value
   "Aval (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , false]) Bnil))
         (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: false, true ]) Bnil))
         (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , true ]) Bnil))
          Anil)))", then elements of r are accessed with expression
   "Esubfield (Esubindex (Eid r) 2) fld".

   We do this: the function repl_val_part' that replaces a part
   of a reference takes as parameters a reference.  It returns a
   value-with-a-hole (i.e. a function from values to values),
   together with the old value that had been in the hole.

   So, one could call the function repl_val_part' with parameters:
   reference = "Esubfield (Esubindex (Eid r) 2) fld".
          This calls repl_val_part' recursively with
          reference = "Esubindex (Eid r) 2".
                This calls repl_val_part' recursively with
                reference = "Eid r".
                It returns the function "fun (v : hvalue) => v"
                       and the complete old value (needs to be looked up from "VM.find r sem").
                           option_map (pair (fun (v : hvalue) => v)) (VM.find r sem)
          It returns the function "fun (v : hvalue) => Aval (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , false]) Bnil))
                                                            (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: false, true ]) Bnil))
                                                            (Acons v
                                                             Anil)))"
                 and the old value "Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , true ]) Bnil)".
   It returns the function "fun (v : hvalue) => Aval (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , false]) Bnil))
                                                     (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip (Gval (Fuint 2) [:: false, true ]) Bnil))
                                                     (Acons (Bval (Bflips fld Nflip v                                  Bnil))
                                                      Anil)))"
          and the old value "Gval (Fuint 2) [:: true , true ]".
   The caller then replaces the old value with the new value by inserting
   the latter into the returned function.  If the reference has flipped
   parts, the old and the new value need to be combined before inserting. *)

(* Helper function for repl_val_part: construct a bundle value with a hole.

   v = name of the field that should become the hole
   bv = bundle value that should get a hole

   Return value: a pair consisting of bundle value bv, but the position of v is replaced with a hole,
                                      and the old value of field v.

(* Run one iteration of calculating the stabilized value of all components in one instance
   (the instance is given implicitly, based on its statement sequence).

             (from this semantics, the values are read in connect statements)
   set_regs = true iff register values should also be stored

   sem_new = new values of all components in the instance, calculated from earlier statements

   We distinguish sem_old and sem_new to ensure the last connect semantics holds:
   sem_old would contain the last connect value from the previous iteration,
   while sem_new may contain a value that is going to be overwritten again. *)
